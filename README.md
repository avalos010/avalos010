## Welcome to my GitHub ü§úüèº

I'm a passionate Front-End Developer with 4 years of experience, always eager for the next challenge. My expertise spans HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and more. I thrive on building polished, high-performance interfaces from the ground up and take pride in quickly tackling bugs and technical debt.

Recently, I've been diving deep into digital twin technology using Python, building simulations like smart home environments and room temperature control as part of my ongoing professional growth. I'm committed to continuous learning and excited to apply my expanding skillset to innovative projects.
