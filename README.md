## Welcome to my Github ü§úüèº 

A passionate front-end developer with 3 years of experience under my belt, currently seeking my next exciting role. I am deeply committed to enhancing my knowledge and skills, as evidenced by my proficiency in a range of cutting-edge technologies including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and many more.

My journey as a Front-end Software Engineer has been nothing short of exciting - I love the thrill of building awesome things from scratch, and take great pride in my ability to debug and resolve technical debt issues quickly and effectively.
