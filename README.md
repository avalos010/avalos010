## Welcome to my Github ü§úüèº 

A passionate front-end developer with 3 years of experience under my belt, currently seeking my next exciting role. I am deeply committed to enhancing my knowledge and skills, as evidenced by my proficiency in a range of cutting-edge technologies including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and many more.

My journey as a Front-end Software Engineer has been nothing short of exciting - I love the thrill of building awesome things from scratch, and take great pride in my ability to debug and resolve technical debt issues quickly and effectively.

As a curious and innovative individual, I'm always eager to explore new technologies and tools that can enhance my productivity and creativity. Recently, I've been deeply intrigued by the power of Firebase, and have been spending much of my free time delving into its intricacies.

Moreover, I'm also deeply committed to improving my eye for design, and spend ample time studying various UI/UX resources available on YouTube. Learning doesn't have to be boring - I believe that by combining learning with relaxation, we can unlock our full potential and make great strides towards our professional goals.
